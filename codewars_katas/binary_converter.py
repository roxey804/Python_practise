"""
a) Let k be the number of bits of n

b) Put k-1 times the digit 0 followed by the digit 1

c) Put number n in binary

d) Concat the result of b) and c)

So we code 0 as 10, 1 as 11 ... etc...

e.g. for digi1t 1

a) 1 in binary is just 1
b) 1
c)1
d) 11

e.g. for digit 6

a) 6 in binary is 110 so 3 bits
b) k-1 = 2, 001
c) 110
d) 001110
